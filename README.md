  h1 {
      font-size: 20px;
  }
  ```
* font-family: style the font's typeface
  ```
  // The font style of the body is 
  body {
      font-family: Verdana;
  }
  ```
* background-color: styles the color of the page's background
  ```
  // The background of the website is gray
  html {
      background-color: gray;
  }
  ```
* width: styles the width of an element
* height: styles the height of an element
  ```
  // The size of the img elements are 300px by 300px

  }
  ```
